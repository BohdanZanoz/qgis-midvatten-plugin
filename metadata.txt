changelog=
        Version 1.6.3b2:
        - Sectionplot: Interactive mode for water levels.
        - Compact water quality report: Added feature to print parameter+unit and date_time as rows.
        - Interlab4 import: Changed logic for duplicate parameters. The smallest unit is now used as the main parameter (ng/l < µg/l < mg/l).
        Version 1.6.3b1:
        - New feature: Utilities / Load stratigraphy symbology to qgis.
        Version 1.6.2:
        - Customplot: New feature: line-label as annotation when clicking on plots.
        - List of values from selected features: Added filter checkbox.
        - Added more supported date formats.
        - Fieldlogger import: Fixed bug where h_toc was empty string.
        - NotFoundQuestion: Added ignore checkbox.
        - Compact water quality report: Bug fixes. Added options for column sorting and row sorting.
        - Sectionplot: New ui for sectionplot. Settings in separate tab but can be floatable to separate window.
        - Sectionplot: Plot and settings now separated in two tabs.
        - Sectionplot: If no section line is selected, Sectionplot now plots like the Stratigraphyplot. (Thanks to Simon O'Connor!)
        - Sectionplot: Capacity colors can now be used in the same way as Stratigraphyplot. (Thanks to Simon O'Connor!)
        - Sectionplot: Hydroexplanation (capacity explanation) can now be used as text for layers. (Thanks to Simon O'Connor!)
        - Sectionplot: Sectionplot can now be maximized. (Thanks to Simon O'Connor!)
        - Sectionplot: Plotsize now set in template in inches in "rcParams": {"figure.figsize": [6.4, 4.8]} and by checking radiobutton Plotsize: "Fixed".
        - Sectionplot: Sectionplot can now be used with one obsid. No longer limited to more than one.
        - Sectionplot: Sectionplot can now be used with only a selected line layer (for plotting DEMS and seismic).
        - Sectionplot: Bug fixes..
        - Sectionplot: Settings tab can now be redocked by closing the window.
        - Sectionplot: Removed redraw button. Legend updates automatically when clicking NavigationToolbar Apply button.
        - Csv import: Added checkbox to ignore not null restrictions. Useful for Postgres importes with serial primary key columns.
        Version 1.6.1:
        - Bug fix for translation support when the overridden locale was not the same as system locale.
        - Water quality report: Fixed error when parameter had "'" in the name.
        - Loggercalibration: Added error message.
        - Loggercalibration: Fix for when logger ts contained nan-values.
        - ContinousColorCycle: Fix for different numpy versions.
        - Loggercalibration: Fixes bug with adjust trend buttons.
        - Loggercalibration: Adjusted "adjust trend" so that it selects x and y values from canvas instead of from database.
                             This makes it possible to adjust trend without measurements.
        - Fieldlogger import: Fixes python error bug when trying to load stored settings (second try)..
        - Customplot: Fix for customplot when colors run out.
        - Sectionplot: Fixes bug where bars where put in legend and one symbol was skipped.
        - Customplot: Added 'legend.midv_ncol' to matplotlib rcparams.
        - Fieldlogger import: Fixes python error bug when trying to load stored settings.
        Version 1.6.0:
        - First public release.
        - Added function to add view_obs_points and view_obs_lines.
        - Introduced messagebar info if view_obs_points/lines is missing.
        - Sectionplot: Printing x and y limits in bottom right corner.
        - Compact water quality report: Bug fixes.
        - Customplot: Bug fix for discontinous plots (#312)
        - Import csv gui: Importing geometries from vectorlayers supported. If a feature has a geometry, a "geometry" column will be added to loaded file data.
        - Fieldlogger import: Bug fix where w_qual_lab parameter was not filled in automatically from stored settings.
        - Fieldlogger import: Instrument and unit are filled automatically based on last entry for current staff.
        - Customplot: Added pandas.DataFrame.Rolling instead of rolling_mean for pandas version >=0.18.0. Changed center to checkbox instead of lineedit.
        - A messagebar message is issued if the database is old.
        - qgis3-branch moved to master branch. The old master branch for qgis2 is now the qgis2-branch.
        - Fieldlogger export: Adjustments to new locations file format.
        - Interlab4: Fix so that the highest resolution parameter (the one with lowest value) is imported as the original parameter name. Duplicates are given a duplicate suffix.
        - Customplot: Fixes #293. Added checkbox "Regular xaxis interval".
        - Customplot: Fixed tab widget resizing bugs. Restructured settings.
        - Interlab4: Fix so that the highest resolution parameter is imported if there are duplicates.
        - Waterqualityreport: Bug fixes for #294.
        - Stratigraphy: Hidden feature: If selected layer is missing in table stratigraphy but has "length" column, it will be plottet as a layer with no geology.
        - Updated translation files.
        - Sectionplot: Methods for producing graded dems (issue #254) but not implemented in gui yet.
        - Interlab4: feature to dump tables to csv.
        - Improved utility to get values from selected features.
        - Update for QGIS3.
