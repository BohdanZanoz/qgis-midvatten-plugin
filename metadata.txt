changelog=
        - Warning! This is an unstable experimental release
        - Fix slow/erroneous creation of spatialite databases under splite 4 (InitSpatialMetadata(1))
        - New feature _and_ database design: import of meteorological data into a new table "meteo" in database
        - New feature for calculating average water flow from accumulated water volume
        - Minor database design changes: now "w_levels"."level_masl" may be null and is no longer -999 by default
        - New behaviour during imports - empty readings (real number) are from now on imported as null instead of zero
        - Alternative backend handling included in code (tsplot2.py) - to avoid time series plots from blocking qgis on specific platform/backend combinations  - But this is not implemented sincce it prevents multiple plots
        - New feature: Section plot!
        - Working on a new feature (see code): Piper diagram!
        - minor html report changes
        - some code cleanup

;for the new plugin repo		
about=The plugin is intended to be a toolset for using QGIS to manage data from hydrogeological investigations. A spatial-enabled SQLite database (i.e. spatialite) is used for storing data. The toolset is developed to be used on Windows but may be useful on other platforms as well.
