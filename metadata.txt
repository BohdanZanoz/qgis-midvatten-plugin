changelog=
        Version 1.3.4
        - support for exporting/importing files for the FieldLogger android/iPhone app
        - automatic updates of attribute table coordinates when an obs_point is created/moved, and vice versa
        - multiple import of logger files from diver office software
        - improved calibration feature for water level from loggers
        - on-the-fly conversion from pulse counts to frequency in the custom plot
        - on-the-fly scaling (gain) and offset for y-values in the custom plot
        - stratigraphy units, plot color and symbols are now editable by the user, so is also the water capacity (as given in stratigraphy table)
        - some database design changes (some new tables and more)
        - work-around in custom plot to fix xaxis date-time format when using  the matplotlib "figure options" to change labels and curves
        - from now the plugin needs spatialite 4
        Version 1.3.3
        - bugfix
        Version 1.3.2
        - better gui for logger calibration
        - code cleanup
        Version 1.3.1
        - bug fix for loading of ui modules when using various tools (was a problem on some win machines for version 1.3.0)
        Version 1.3.0:
        - new fature: export data from database to a set of csv files or another spatialite-daabase
        Version 1.2.1:
        - temporarily adding print outputs from wqualreport.py for debugging purposes, turns out to be a samba-LAN issue
        Version 1.2.0:
        - new feature export data for 3D borehole plots with Qgis2threejs plugin
        - minor interface, metadata and bug fixes in section plot, w_levels form and database table about_db, bugfix for loading swedish stylefiles
        - changed behaviour of stratigraphy plot - it will now silently skip any obsid without stratigraphy info
        Version 1.1.0
        - New feature: Piper diagram!
        - New feature: Custom plots!
        - New feature: Section plot!
        - New feature: Calculate average water flow from accumulated water volume readings
        - New feature: Vacuuming database
        - New feature: Database backup
        - New feature _and_ database design: import of meteorological data into a new table "meteo" in database
        - Minor database design changes: now "w_levels"."level_masl" may be null and is no longer -999 by default
        - New behaviour during imports - empty readings (real number) are from now on imported as null instead of zero
        - New behaviour in drillreport - it will now present statistics for 'level_masl' instead of 'meas', if number of 'level_masl' > number of 'meas' 
        - Additional minor html report changes
        - Fix slow/erroneous creation of spatialite databases under splite 4 (InitSpatialMetadata(1))
        - Finally, but not least:
            ***** WARNING **********
            This plugin version will break all your earlier Midvatten plugin form logics for existing projects!
            This version includes simplified custom forms and no form logics for user data input.
            See plugin homepage for more information.
