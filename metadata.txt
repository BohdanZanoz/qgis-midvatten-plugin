changelog=
        Version 1.6.1b:
        Sectionplot: New ui for sectionplot. Settings in separate tab but can be floatable to separate window.
        Sectionplot: Plot and settings now separated in two tabs.
        Sectionplot: If no section line is selected, Sectionplot now plots like the Stratigraphyplot. (Thanks to Simon O'Connor!)
        Sectionplot: Capacity colors can now be used in the same way as Stratigraphyplot. (Thanks to Simon O'Connor!)
        Sectionplot: Hydroexplanation (capacity explanation) can now be used as text for layers. (Thanks to Simon O'Connor!)
        Sectionplot: Sectionplot can now be maximized. (Thanks to Simon O'Connor!)
        Sectionplot: Plotsize now set in template in inches in "rcParams": {"figure.figsize": [6.4, 4.8]} and by checking radiobutton Plotsize: "Fixed".
        Sectionplot: Sectionplot can now be used with one obsid. No longer limited to more than one.
        Sectionplot: Sectionplot can now be used with only a selected line layer (for plotting DEMS and seismic).
        Sectionplot: Bug fixes.
        Version 1.6.0:
        - First public release.
        - Added function to add view_obs_points and view_obs_lines.
        - Introduced messagebar info if view_obs_points/lines is missing.
        - Sectionplot: Printing x and y limits in bottom right corner.
        - Compact water quality report: Bug fixes.
        - Customplot: Bug fix for discontinous plots (#312)
        Version 1.6.0b8
        - Import csv gui: Importing geometries from vectorlayers supported. If a feature has a geometry, a "geometry" column will be added to loaded file data.
        - Fieldlogger import: Bug fix where w_qual_lab parameter was not filled in automatically from stored settings.
        - Fieldlogger import: Instrument and unit are filled automatically based on last entry for current staff.
        - Customplot: Added pandas.DataFrame.Rolling instead of rolling_mean for pandas version >=0.18.0. Changed center to checkbox instead of lineedit.
        - A messagebar message is issued if the database is old.
        Version 1.6.0b7
        - qgis3-branch moved to master branch. The old master branch for qgis2 is now the qgis2-branch.
        Version 1.6.0b6
        - Fieldlogger export: Adjustments to new locations file format.
        - Interlab4: Fix so that the highest resolution parameter (the one with lowest value) is imported as the original parameter name. Duplicates are given a duplicate suffix.
        Version 1.6.0b5
        - Customplot: Fixes #293. Added checkbox "Regular xaxis interval".
        - Customplot: Fixed tab widget resizing bugs. Restructured settings.
        - Interlab4: Fix so that the highest resolution parameter is imported if there are duplicates.
        - Waterqualityreport: Bug fixes for #294.
        Version 1.6.0b4:
        - Stratigraphy: Hidden feature: If selected layer is missing in table stratigraphy but has "length" column, it will be plottet as a layer with no geology.
        Version 1.6.0b3:
        - Updated translation files.
        Version 1.6.0b2:
        - Sectionplot: Methods for producing graded dems (issue #254) but not implemented in gui yet.
        - Interlab4: feature to dump tables to csv.
        - Improved utility to get values from selected features.
        Version 1.6.0b1:
        - Update for QGIS3.
