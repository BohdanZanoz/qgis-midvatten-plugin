        - Better cleanup of the temporary table during imports.
        - Fieldlogger import: Many hidden improvements.
        - Fieldlogger import: Changing period filter updates sublocations.
        - General csv import: Fixed bug when two database columns were to use the same file column.

        - Bugfix for fieldlogger import for windows users.
        - Several improvements for fieldlogger import and export.
        - The function for finding similar values (for obsids for example)
        is now much improved.
        - The fields for csv import are prefilled if the header of the chosen

        - Small improvements and better error messages for general csv importer
        Version 1.3.8 - 1.3.10
        - New feature: general csv importer!
        - New feature: locale selected at database creation and embedded in db
        - New feature: import Diver Office files
        - Rework of new feature: Import/Export of FieldLogger files
        - several bugfixes

        - New feature: multiple import of logger files from diver office software
        - improved calibration feature for water level from loggers
        - New feature: on-the-fly conversion from pulse counts to frequency in the custom plot
        - New feature: on-the-fly scaling (gain) and offset for y-values in the custom plot
        - New feature: stratigraphy units, plot color and symbols are now editable by the user, so is also the water capacity (as given in stratigraphy table)
        - some database design changes (some new tables and more)
        - work-around in custom plot to fix xaxis date-time format when using  the matplotlib "figure options" to change labels and curves

        - new fature: export data from database to a set of csv files or another spatialite-daabase
        Version 1.2.1:
        - temporarily adding print outputs from wqualreport.py for debugging purposes, turns out to be a samba-LAN issue
        Version 1.2.0:
        - new feature export data for 3D borehole plots with Qgis2threejs plugin
        - minor interface, metadata and bug fixes in section plot, w_levels form and database table about_db, bugfix for loading swedish stylefiles

        Version 1.1.0
        - New feature: Piper diagram!
        - New feature: Custom plots!

        - New feature _and_ database design: import of meteorological data into a new table "meteo" in database
        - Minor database design changes: now "w_levels"."level_masl" may be null and is no longer -999 by default
        - New behaviour during imports - empty readings (real number) are from now on imported as null instead of zero
        - New behaviour in drillreport - it will now present statistics for 'level_masl' instead of 'meas', if number of 'level_masl' > number of 'meas' 
        - Additional minor html report changes
        - Fix slow/erroneous creation of spatialite databases under splite 4 (InitSpatialMetadata(1))
        - Finally, but not least:
            ***** WARNING **********
            This plugin version will break all your earlier Midvatten plugin form logics for existing projects!
            This version includes simplified custom forms and no form logics for user data input.
            See plugin homepage for more information.
